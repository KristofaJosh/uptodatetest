# Instructions

You can find the tasks in .js files in src folder. Explanation of the problem for each task is in the beginning of the file.

Tasks are also accompanied by tests which you can execute to see if your solution is on the right track. Check the tests
as this will help you to see expected input and output of the tasks. Respect the format of input and output, otherwise our
automated tests will fail even your solution is correct. You are also free to add more tests if that will help you, but 
writing new tests is NOT required.

To execute all the tests, use standard:

```
npm test
```

You have 90 minutes to complete this coding challenge and send us solution either as a zipped source code or link to your git repository.

Good luck!
